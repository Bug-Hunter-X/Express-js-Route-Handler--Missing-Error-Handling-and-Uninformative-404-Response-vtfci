# Express.js Route Handler Bug: Missing Error Handling and Ambiguous 404 Response

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: inadequate error handling and unclear error responses.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches a user by ID.  It fails to properly handle cases where the ID is invalid or the user is not found, leading to a poor user experience.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and informative responses.

## Bug:

The original code lacks error handling for several scenarios:

1. **Invalid User ID:**  If the `userId` is not a valid number (e.g., a string), `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, causing the `find` operation to fail silently.  
2. **User Not Found:**  If no user matches the provided ID, the code sends a simple 404 status code without any information to the client about the cause of the error.

## Solution:

The solution incorporates the following improvements:

1. **Input Validation:** The code checks if `userId` is a valid number before attempting to find the user.
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The code handles both the invalid ID and user-not-found scenarios explicitly, sending appropriate error messages with the HTTP status code (400 for bad request, 404 for not found).
3. **Informative Responses:**  The responses now include informative messages explaining the reason for the error.
